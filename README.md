PATHFINDING AND MAZE GENERATION VISUALIZER

Graphical User Interface built using React Framework to visualize Pathfinding Algorithms and Maze Generation Algorithms. Feel free to fork or download this project if you would like to try this out or use this code as the base to create your own Pathfinding Visualizer.

Pathfinding Algorithms:

Dijkstra's Algorithm
Breadth First Search
Depth First Search

Maze Generation Algorithms:
Random Maze
Recursive Division Maze

Thank you
I hope you found the project useful and interesting.
